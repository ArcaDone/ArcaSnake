# ArcaSnake

## Game implementation using Kotlin

This is an implementation of the classic Game "Snake", in which you control a serpent roaming around the garden looking for pizzas. Be careful, though, because when you catch one, not only will you become longer, but you'll move faster. Running into yourself or the walls will end the game.
